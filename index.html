    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This interactive dashboard allows you to explore patient vitals recorded in real-time during surgical procedures. 
      By selecting different vital signs and grouping variables, you can visualize how physiological signals 
      like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation vary across types of surgeries and emergency conditions.
      Highlighted danger zones and interactive legends help identify trends that may correspond with risk factors 
      during operations. This tool is designed for researchers, clinicians, and students interested in perioperative data.

    <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
    <p>
      The visualizations are powered by data from the 
      <a href="https://vitaldb.net/dataset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VitalDB</a> project, 
      which contains biosignal recordings from <strong>6,388 surgeries</strong> performed at Seoul National University Hospital in South Korea. 
      These surgeries were conducted between 2005 and 2014. The dataset provides synchronized, high-frequency intraoperative data 
      collected from anesthesia machines and monitoring devices at a 1–500 Hz sampling rate. Each surgery record includes time-series 
      measurements such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and additional metadata such as 
      type of surgery, emergency status, and outcome labels.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>signal:</strong> The type of biosignal (e.g., HR, MAP, SpO₂)</li>
      <li><strong>value:</strong> The measured value at a given time</li>
      <li><strong>norm_time:</strong> Normalized surgery timeline from 0 (start) to 1 (end)</li>
      <li><strong>optype:</strong> Type of surgery performed</li>
      <li><strong>emop:</strong> Whether the surgery was performed under emergency conditions</li>
